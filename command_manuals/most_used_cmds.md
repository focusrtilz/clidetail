### Goals of clidetail.com
We notice that despite there are manpages for users to look up the usage of commands and options. However, users sometimes still get lost or confused when reading the manual. Therefore, the goals of __`clidetail.com`__ is to provide insight, details and explain both commands and corresponding options out of line. We're also calling for people who are interested in making the better versions and understanding of manuals. Or you can say helping this world a better place :D Please check our [github repository](https://github.com/focusrtilz/clidetail.github.io), issues and PRs are welcomed! 

### Most used bsd or linux commands overview

When we need to concatenate and print files we can use `cat` command. We now provide explanations of option [-b](https://clidetail.com/manuals/cat_b/), [-net](https://clidetail.com/manuals/cat_net/), [-s](https://clidetail.com/manuals/cat_s/). And if we'd like to change our working directory, we have explanation of option [-](https://clidetail.com/manuals/cd_hyphen/) which is [hyphen-minus](https://clidetail.com/manuals/cd_hyphen/) for command `cd`. 

It is important to set or change the permissions of files. We now provide explanation of [absolute mode](https://clidetail.com/manuals/chmod_abs_mode/) and [symbolic mode](https://clidetail.com/manuals/chmod_sym_mode/) for command `chmod`. We also provide explanation of [ACL Manipulation](https://clidetail.com/manuals/chmod_plus_a/) which is rarely discussed for most users.

Then, if we want to copy files, we can use command `cp`. What surprised us is that this command has a protection mechanism when copying file. Check explanation of option [-p](https://clidetail.com/manuals/cp_lowercase_p/) for more details!

Sometimes we need to search particular patterns in files. We can use command `grep` to do it! See how we can use option [-e](https://clidetail.com/manuals/grep_e_pipe_grep_v/), option [-v](https://clidetail.com/manuals/grep_e_pipe_grep_v/) and [pipe](https://clidetail.com/manuals/grep_e_pipe_grep_v/) to optimize the searching. 

The other most used command is `ls`. This command helps us to list files, directories and their attributes in various ways. Please see our explanations of option [-1](https://clidetail.com/manuals/ls1/), [-1l](https://clidetail.com/manuals/ls1l_override/), [-C1](https://clidetail.com/manuals/lsC1_override/), [-A](https://clidetail.com/manuals/ls_uppercase_A/), [-a](https://clidetail.com/manuals/lsa/), [-r](https://clidetail.com/manuals/lsr/) and [-xC](https://clidetail.com/manuals/lsxC_override/).

Often times, we use directories for file classification. We can use command `mkdir` to `make directory`. See our explanation of option [-m](https://clidetail.com/manuals/mkdir_m/) for more details. Also, we can use command `mv` to move files from one directory to the other. Check our explanation of option [-vi](https://clidetail.com/manuals/mv_vi/).

It is also important to know which directory we're currently at! We can use command `pwd` for this purpose. Please check our explanations of option [-L](https://clidetail.com/manuals/pwd_L_P/) and option [-p](https://clidetail.com/manuals/pwd_L_P/) for more insights.

We sometimes need to execute with higher privileges. We can use command `sudo` for this! See how we can use option [-k](https://clidetail.com/manuals/sudo_k/) and option [-K](https://clidetail.com/manuals/sudo_uppercase_k/) to secure our machine!

And when we need to display last parts of files. We can not only display the last lines, but also, last bytes. See how we can use command __`tail`__ with option [-c](https://clidetail.com/manuals/tail_c/) to achieve this goal.
